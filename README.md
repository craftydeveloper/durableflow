# DurableFlow

A durable workflow engine core for idempotent steps, retries, leases, and crash recovery.

## Why this project

DurableFlow defines explicit job transitions, attempt accounting, and bounded exponential retry delays. Its core is deterministic so storage and worker leasing can be added without hiding state changes.

## What is included

- A typed domain core with a project-specific algorithm.
- A small HTTP API for creating and listing local records.
- An in-memory repository interface that can be replaced by durable storage.
- Unit and HTTP tests, strict type checking, and continuous integration.
- Operational and architecture notes that call out the prototype boundaries.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer.

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run dev
```

The development server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Set `HOST` and `PORT` to change the local address. The record API is intended for development until authentication, durable storage, rate limits, and deployment controls are added.

## API

- `GET /healthz` returns service health.
- `GET /api/records` lists records in the in-memory store.
- `GET /api/records/:id` retrieves one record.
- `POST /api/records` validates and creates a record.

## Quality bar

Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` before proposing a change. Keep domain logic deterministic, document data assumptions, and add regression tests for edge cases.
